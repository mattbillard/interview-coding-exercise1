        <p>We have created an API that simulates searching for a stock, adding it to a portfolio, and streaming live (fake) price updates.</p>

        <p>Create a UI that allows a user to</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Search</strong><br>
                Search for a stock by company name
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Results</strong><br>
                Show the results as a table. <br>
                Click on a result to add it to the "portfolio"
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Portfolio</strong><br>
                Show the portfolio as a table displaying stock symbol, company name, currency, and price. <br>
                Live price updates should update the portfolio table
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Solve this in the way you feel is best. <br>
            You can use/add/download any libraries you like. <br>
            If you get stumped or don't understand something, come and ask us. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            You have 1 hour. <br>
            If you solve the problem early, add additional features that will make the app more user-friendly.
        </p>

        <p>See console for some useful output</p>
